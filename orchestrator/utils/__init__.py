orchestrator.utils

Utility package for orchestrator-level helpers and adapters.

- Place stateless shared functions and adapters here.
- Re-export useful adapters or logging utils for easy orchestrator imports.
- Example: search result adapters, logging setup, generic validators.
"""

# Example: If you want to make a function available at package-level import
# from .adapter_helpers import search_results_to_schema_context

# You may also define simple utilities here if needed.
# For now, this file just marks utils as a package and provides doc/cohesion.
